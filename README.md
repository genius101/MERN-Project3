MERN Web stack consists of following components:

- [ ]	MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.
- [ ]	ExpressJS: A server side Web Application framework for Node.js.
- [ ]	ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.
- [ ]	Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.
